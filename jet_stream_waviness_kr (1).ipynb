    "The scientific theory and model of jet stream waviness plays a pivotal role in our understanding of atmospheric dynamics and climate patterns. The jet stream, a high-altitude, fast-flowing air current, is a key component of the Earth's atmospheric circulation. In recent years, researchers have been increasingly intrigued by the phenomenon of jet stream waviness, characterized by meandering patterns that deviate from the traditional straight and zonal flow. This waviness has been linked to a range of atmospheric and climatic phenomena, including extreme weather events, prolonged periods of heat or cold, and disruptions to regional weather patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the factors influencing jet stream waviness is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change on a global scale. Scientists employ sophisticated models and theories to investigate the intricate interactions between atmospheric components, such as temperature gradients, pressure systems, and the Coriolis effect, which contribute to the development of jet stream waviness. This research not only enhances our ability to forecast weather patterns but also provides valuable insights into the broader implications of a changing climate on ecosystems, agriculture, and human societies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models in our paper focus primarily on how the Linearized Planetary Geostrophic Motion model will change as the zonally asymmetric thermal forcing changes with global warming. They use graphs to depict the flow of the jet stream in the y and z dimensions, in addition to how it looks reflected over the surface of the Earth. Alternatively, our paper focuses on the Linearized Planetary Geostrophic Motion model, and solving it for Phi as a function of elevation. This will show us how the pressure perturbations in the jet stream change with height. "

    "The fundamental physical processes involved with this model include wind, pressure, rising motion, the coriolous effect and stability. These all contribute to the general understanding of the model and make up different aspects of the Jet Stream. The parameter \"phi\"  represents the perturbation in the pressure field of the jet stream. It is a fundamental part of the differential equation and how phi changes with respect to height is the focus of the following models."
